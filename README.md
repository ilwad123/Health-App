**HEALTH-APP Group project**

A refferal web app used for medical proffessionals to refer patients to dieticians based on their physiological measurements.

**Own contributions**
Helped display patient data in a presentable manner in a table with accessible links, including a search bar and filtering options for referred , non-referred patients and all patients, and created the structure of the app.py file.
I also collaborated on other sections of the web app.

Conducted automated testing to see if the data is displayed properly on the website and the functionality of the wesbsite is working good , which is in the testingref.py file.
